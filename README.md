Dotfiles that I help me to configure my setup. Vim ones are especially interesting, have a look if you like vim and you want have a mixture of cool plugins while using vim. I use [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), to manage the vim plugins, check their documentation to see how you can install the plugins.
